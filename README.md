## ML-Model-Flask-Deployment
This is an assignment to step down the Operationalization of BMI Prediction model.

### Prerequisites
Need to have Python version, along with Pandas,  Scikit Learn (for Machine Leraning Model) and Flask (for API) installed.

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts :
1. Dummy-Data.csv - This file contains the sample dataset and some custom calculated values.
2. TCS Assignment.ipnyb - This contains code for our Machine Learning model to predict BMI as well as API creation steps to explain the operationalize approach.
